## How it works

The app consists of a header card, a list and an image card at the bottom. when the mouse is hovered over an item in the list, the picture of that item will be shown on the image card. If the item doesn't have an image a picture of a shopping cart wil be shown instead. 

When you click on a grocery in the list a dropdown will appear with the possible description and image of the selected item. 

A new grocery can be added by pressing the green plus button. When the required name field is filled and possibly a description or photo has been added, the grocery can be added to the list by again clicking the green plus button. 

Items in the list can be edited by clicking the pencil button after their own name. A grocery can be deleted by clicking the red trashcan.
